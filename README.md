I have written an R-package called Deansstats and a shiny app called MultiData. 
To install Deansstats on your Rstudio, run the following command: devtools::install_github("https://github.com/asarafoglou-ptns/Essoh-DeansMV.git")
Once you have installed Deansstats, run the code saved in the following file: "Script to call the app_MultiData.R". You will find thise file in my main branch.
Running that code will give you access to the app MultiData.
